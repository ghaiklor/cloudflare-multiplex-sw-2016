# cloudflare-multiplex-sw-2016

Technical task for CloudFlare (Aug 2016)

## Description

Service Workers are currently quickly evolving and it might be interesting to explore various ways they can be used in for the client-side performance.

For this task, I would like you to write a Service Worker that would multiplex big downloads such as video and audio files (since itâ€™s SW, this should work for both <video> tags as well as direct downloads from the same origin) by splitting them into a few parallel chunk requests (similarly to download managers), and combining responses into one in a correct order so that this process would happen transparently for the browser.

## Known Issues

__What happens if Service Workers are not supported by browser?__

_Service Worker will not be registered and page will proceed as usual._

__What happens when original request\response with some headers will be replaced by my own request\response without them?__

_By now, I'm cloning original request with all properties in there into new `Response` object. Afterwards, I'm making partial requests via this cloned request. Concatenating response from these partial requests, I'm responding with concatenated body and headers from original `HEAD` response._

__What happens in case when server doesn't understand `Range` header and will reply with full content, but not partial one?__

_IN PROGRESS_

__What are the possible response codes and what would happen with your implementation if those are not simple 200 OK? (redirects, server errors, network errors etc.)__

_TODO_

__What penalties on the network does current implementation have on big files (e.g. movies)?__

_TODO_

__What would happen to form posts, file uploads etc. with current implementation?__

_TODO_

__What would happen to third-party requests going through your library?__

_TODO_
